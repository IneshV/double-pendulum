# double-pendulum
A system of two rods and masses, with angles (θ1,θ2). Lagrangian mechanics yields coupled differential equations, solved numerically. Tiny changes in initial angles produce huge variations. Adjust code for mesmerizing chaos! See the code for details and watch the mesmerizing motion!
